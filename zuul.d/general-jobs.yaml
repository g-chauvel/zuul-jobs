      Mirrors a tested project repository to a remote git server.

      .. zuul:jobvar:: git_mirror_credentials
        :type: dict

        This is expected to be a Zuul Secret with these keys:

        .. zuul:jobvar:: user

          SSH user for the remote git repository

        .. zuul:jobvar:: host

          SSH host for the remote git repository

        .. zuul:jobvar:: ssh_key

          Literal private key contents.
          Should start with something like ``-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----``.

        .. zuul:jobvar:: host_key

          SSH host key of the remote git server.
          Can be obtained with ``ssh-keyscan -H <host>``.

      .. zuul:jobvar:: git_mirror_repository

        Path of the remote git repository
    run: playbooks/upload-git-mirror/run.yaml

- job:
    name: validate-zone-db
    description: |
      Validate zone.db files in project.

      Responds to these variables:

      .. zuul:jobvar:: zone_files
         :default: {{ ansible_user_dir }}/{{ zuul.project.src_dir }}

         Search for zone.db files recursively in this directory.
         Format should be domain.xyz/zone.db, where the parent
         directory is named for the zone described.

      .. zuul:jobvar:: zone_db_list
         :default: []

         Override the default searching above with explicit
         domain/path references (see validate-zone-db role)
    run: playbooks/validate-zone-db/run.yaml
